EE2003 Computer Organization is a course from the Electrical Engineering Department at IIT Madras, July-Nov 2022

* Expt 2: Floating point addition (32-bit version)
The goal of the experiment was to implement a floating point adder in Verilog to take two 32-b values as input, interpret them as IEEE-754 floating point values, and add them. Corner cases were handled using some conventions which is mentioned in the code.

* Expt 3: Single Cycle Implementation using RISC-V architechture (32-bit)
The goal of the experiment was to implement all instructions of the RV32I set to make a single cycle CPU using Verilog.
